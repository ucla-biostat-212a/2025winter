## Methodology & Model Building

- Method(s) chosen are highly appropriate for the problem.
- Implementation is efficient and technically correct.
- Model selection and tuning are well justified with clear reasoning.

## Code Quality & Reproducibility

- Code is well-organized, properly documented, and uses clear variable/function names.
- Follows best practices for reproducibility (e.g., notebooks with clear workflow, version control).	- Code is mostly organized, with meaningful comments and function names.


## Clarity of Communication

- Explanation of methods and results is clear, concise, and logically structured.
- Uses visuals (tables/graphs) effectively to illustrate points.
- Use text to describe your final results and conclusions 

## Mathematical derivation 

- All steps in the derivation are correct and logically sound.
- Each step is clearly explained, with proper justification and clear logical flow.
- Transitions between steps are easy to follow.
- No algebraic or conceptual errors.
- Uses consistent and standard mathematical notation throughout.
- Variables, functions, and symbols are clearly defined before use.

## Bonus questions

- They are optional. 
- Points gained will be calculated in the bonus points categories and will be considered when giving the final grades. 

## Late HW 

- For each day a submission is late, 10% of the possible points will be deducted.
- Late submissions made within 10 days of the deadline will still be graded and receive feedback. Beyond this 10-day window, grading cannot be guaranteed.
